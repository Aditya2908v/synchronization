Synchronization is used to make sure by some synchronization method
that only one thread can access the resource at a given point in time.

Java provides a way of creating threads and synchronizing their tasks using
synchronized blocks.

A synchronized block in Java is synchronized on some object. All synchronized
blocks synchronize on the same object and can only have one thread executed
inside them at a time. All other threads attempting to enter the synchronized
block are blocked until the thread inside the synchronized block exits the block.
